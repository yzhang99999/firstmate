# Rovo CLI

Verified 2026-09-02 on Rovo CLI 202609.1.2 for crewmate/scout work only.
Not verified, and not naturally verifiable, as a secondmate or primary: rovo has no turn-end hook and no primary supervision protocol, the same gap that scopes muse to crewmate/scout.

## Operating facts

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Binary | `resolve_rovo_binary` in `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` resolves `PATH`, then falls back to `$HOME/.local/bin/rovo`; spawning refuses if neither is executable. |
| Launch | Bare `rovo run --yolo` (no positional brief), the kimi launch-then-send shape: a readiness gate on the `Welcome to Rovo!` banner, then a typed absolute brief pointer, then a delivery-confirmation gate. A positional brief is dead-on-arrival (see "Launch and readiness" below). |
| Models | `--model <model>`, discovered from the in-session `/models` command or ACP `session/new`; the observed live list (GPT-5.6 Terra/Sol/Luna, GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, several Claude Sonnet/Opus/Haiku ids, Gemini 3 ids) is per-account and must never be hardcoded. |
| Busy state | Rendered-tail fallback, isolated to rovo like Grok's - the animated `Rovo is thinking...` line, matched by `fm_busy_rovo_tail_busy` in `../../../bin/fm-busy-lib.sh` - because rovo's `eventHooks` fire at tool granularity only (`on_tool_start`/`on_tool_end`), never at turn-end, so no semantic writer exists to arm. |
| Exit command | `/exit` (also `/quit`, and a single idle Ctrl-C); prints `Run rovo --restore <session-id> to resume your conversation`. |
| Interrupt | Single Escape is the cancel key and prints `Agent cancelled`; `../../../bin/fm-control-lib.sh` records its acknowledgement source as `none` (see "Interrupt: confirmed under real tmux" in `references/harness/rovo-troubleshooting.md`), the same conservative choice as claude/codex/grok/kimi/cursor. |
| Skill invocation | `/<skill>`, the Claude/Grok form, but see "Skill-loading interop gap" below - a rovo worker cannot invoke a firstmate skill until that gap is resolved. |
| Autonomy | `--disable-permission-checks` (alias `--yolo`) runs every file CRUD operation and bash command without confirmation, though its own printed caveat keeps permission checks on tools accessing Atlassian data and user-provided MCP servers, which crew/scout tasks never touch. |
| File access | rovo confines every file-tool operation to its launch worktree by default, so the standard instructions/steering/status/report loop - whose files live in the firstmate home outside the worktree - fails until granted. `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh`'s `rovo_config_override_flag` grants `toolPermissions.allowedExternalPaths` at launch, folded into the single `--config-override` (see Effort), for exactly this task's brief directory, steering inbox, and status file. The grant lifts the file tools only; rovo's bash tool stays worktree-confined regardless, so the crewmate status line's `echo ... >> status` lands only because the worker falls back to its own file tool for the append. See `../../../../docs/verification/rovo.md`. |
| Trust dialog | None observed on a clean launch in a fresh worktree; `--yolo` clears crew/scout's confirmation prompts, but it is not the only launch grant the standard flow needs - see File access for the required `allowedExternalPaths` grant. |
| Environment marker | `ATLASSIAN_AGENT_TYPE=rovo` (most specific) and `ROVODEV_CLI=1`, both set on rovo's tool subprocesses alongside `AGENT=rovodev_cli`, none of which rovo scrubs from an inherited `CLAUDECODE`/`CURSOR_AGENT`/etc - so `../../../bin/fm-harness.sh` tests rovo's markers before the `CLAUDECODE` line (the same ordering hazard cursor already documents, issue #3517) and `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh` clears foreign markers at the launch boundary too. |
| Process name | `comm=rovo` on the tool subprocess and the `rovo run` process itself, because the installed wrapper execs the generation's `rovo` shim so argv[0] stays `rovo` even though the on-disk binary is `atlassian_cli_rovodev`. |
| Composer | The existing bordered `box` shape family (`╭─╮ │ │ ╰─╯`) `../../../bin/fm-composer-lib.sh` already reads, with an empty composer showing de-emphasized suggestion chips and a `? for shortcuts.` hint, and a busy footer reading `Enter to queue, Ctrl+Enter to steer`. |
| Effort | `agent.efficiencyLevel`, accepted `low\|medium\|high\|max` (default `medium`, no CLI `--effort` flag), set live through rovo's single `--config-override` flag - folded into the SAME JSON object as the mandatory `allowedExternalPaths` grant, never emitted as a standalone override, because `--config-override` is single-value (see `../../../../docs/verification/rovo.md`) - with an `xhigh` request recorded in task metadata but omitted from that object per `../../../references/common/model-and-effort.md`'s record-and-omit contract because rovo has no `xhigh`. |

## Detection

`../../../bin/fm-harness.sh` checks `ATLASSIAN_AGENT_TYPE=rovo` and `ROVODEV_CLI=1` before the `CLAUDECODE` line, then falls back to ancestry (`rovo)` case, beside `kimi)`).
Both layers matter for the same reason cursor's do: marker ordering covers a rovo session a human started by hand under an inherited foreign marker, while `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh`'s launch-boundary `env -u` clearing covers every firstmate-launched worker regardless of ordering.

## Launch and readiness

The launch template clears `CLAUDECODE`, `PI_CODING_AGENT`, `GROK_AGENT`, and `FM_PI_HARNESS` inline (rovo's own foreign-marker exposure), and the shared outer wrap clears `CURSOR_AGENT`/`CURSOR_INVOKED_AS` like every other non-cursor harness.
rovo launches BARE (`rovo run --yolo`, plus any `--model`/`--config-override` flags) and takes its brief only after the TUI comes up - the same launch-then-send shape as kimi, wired through the same shared readers (`fm_backend_capture`, `fm_backend_composer_state`, `fm_backend_send_text_submit`):

1. **Readiness gate** (`rovo_wait_for_ready` in `../../../bin/fm-spawn.sh`): poll for the fresh-launch `Welcome to Rovo!` ASCII banner, falling back to composer-empty. The banner is the primary signal because the composer-empty fallback is weaker for rovo than for kimi - rovo's idle composer renders an inline placeholder chip whose luminance sits above the ghost-strip threshold (see "Composer ghost text" in `references/harness/rovo-troubleshooting.md`), so it can read non-empty.
2. **Typed pointer**: `Read the brief at <absolute-path> and follow it exactly.`, submitted through `fm_backend_send_text_submit` (the exact wording and mechanism kimi uses).
3. **Delivery gate** (`rovo_wait_for_delivery`): composer empty AND either the echoed pointer text (`Read the brief at`) has scrolled into view or rovo's `Context:` footer percentage has advanced off zero. rovo's real footer is `Context: <bar> N.N% NN.NK/NNNK` (e.g. `Context: ▎ 3.3% 30.1K/922K`); the delivery regex tolerates the bar glyph and arbitrary spacing but anchors to the digits before the `%`, so the always-nonzero denominator (`.../922K`) can never masquerade as usage.

A positional brief is dead-on-arrival: `rovo run --yolo "<brief>"` loads, never enters a working state, and drops back to an idle shell within about 10-15 seconds - confirmed independently four times over a raw PTY and once under real tmux 3.6a with the exact `fm-spawn.sh` send-keys shape. `--startup-receipt` cannot rescue that shape either: it requires "prompt-free interactive mode" (`Invalid value: --startup-receipt requires prompt-free interactive mode in a terminal`), so it cannot gate a launch that will have a message typed into it. The launch-then-send shape, by contrast, is confirmed live end to end (bare launch -> `Welcome to Rovo!` -> typed pointer -> `Rovo is thinking` for a real bash tool call -> clean `/exit`); see `../../../../docs/verification/rovo.md`.
rovo leaves no worktree-resident artifact and no firstmate-owned sidecar at all, and has no readiness receipt or session-id to record.

## Troubleshooting

`references/harness/rovo-troubleshooting.md` owns the known composer ghost-text gap behind steering retries, the interrupt evidence, OAuth token lifetime, and the structured-protocol upgrade path.

## Skill-loading interop gap

rovo's skill loader rejects every firstmate skill: `Invalid skill definition in .../SKILL.md: 'metadata -> internal': Input should be a valid string`, because firstmate's `metadata.internal` is a boolean and rovo's schema wants a string.
This blocks `/no-mistakes` and every other firstmate skill invocation inside a rovo worker until firstmate's `SKILL.md` frontmatter is made rovo-compatible (a separate, deferred follow-up - it touches every skill file and the installer contract, per `../../firstmate-coding-guidelines/SKILL.md`).
A `no-mistakes`-mode rovo ship crewmate is blocked by this gap; a rovo scout, which invokes no skill, is unaffected.
